# PdM
In this project we use three python files. The basic file is PdM.py which listens for alerts from Brainium portal which are triggered due to anomalous vibration patterns. The other two programs are optional that are used to find the temperature and magnetic field of the motor.

To run these files use commands
```
python Pdm.py
python Temperature.py
python MagField.py
```
