# Firebase

Firebase is a mobile and web application development platform. Firebase frees developers to focus on crafting fantastic user experiences. You don’t need to manage servers. You don’t need to write APIs. Firebase is your server, your API and your datastore, all written so generically that you can modify it to suit most needs. In our project, we use Firebase real-time database to instantly post and retrieve data so that there is no time delay.

While designing the mobile application we need to fill a thing called Firebase URL.

## To find Firebase URL

1. Go to Firebase
2. Then go and open your project (If you have no projects create one)
3. Then move to Real-Time Database in Database
4. The selected URL in the screenshot is the Firebase URL
